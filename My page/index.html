                <p>The institutional framework of higher education in India consists of Universities and Colleges. As
                    reported in 2015, India has 760 universities and 38,498 colleges.
                    India's higher education system works at both private and public level universities. Public
                    universities function under the directives issued by the Government of India and the state
                    governments whereas private universities function under various approved educational bodies and
                    societies.
                    India has a publicly funded higher education system that is the third largest in the world, next to
                    the United States and China. The main governing body at the tertiary level is the University Grants
                    Commission, which enforces its standards, advises the government, and helps coordinate between the
                    centre and the state. Accreditation for higher learning is overseen by 15 autonomous institutions
                    established by the University Grants Commission (UGC).
                    As per the latest 2011 Census, about 8.15% (98.615 million) of Indians are graduates, with Union
                    Territories of Chandigarh and Delhi topping the list with 24.65% and 22.56% of their population
                    being graduates respectively. Indian higher education system has expanded at a fast pace by adding
                    nearly 20,000 colleges and more than 8 million students in a decade from 2000–01 to 2010–11. As of
                    2020, India has over 1000 universities, with a break up of 54 central universities, 416 state
                    universities, 125 deemed universities, 361 private universities and 159 Institutes of National
                    Importance which include AIIMS, IIMs, IIITs, IISERs, IITs and NITs among others. Other institutions
                    include 52,627 colleges as government degree colleges, private colleges, standalone institutes and
                    post-graduate research institutions, functioning under these universities as reported by the MHRD in
                    2020.
